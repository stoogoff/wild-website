			<p>The development of the <strong>ALIS</strong> dreamshare device has changed the world.</p>
			<p>The technology allows dreamers to enter a shared experience, to delve into the unconscious minds of those in need of help, to create worlds of adventure and exploration, to experience a reality limited only by your imagination.</p>
			<p>But without the proper training, using the <strong>ALIS</strong> device can be a dangerous and frightening experience.</p>
			<p>In the <strong>WILD RPG</strong> players enter this world, where technology and dreams meet. Where dream creatures struggle to break into the waking world, and where you can live out your wildest dreams.</p>
			<p>The <strong>WILD: Dream Dive Training Simulation</strong> is an introduction to the <strong>WILD RPG</strong>, sending dreamers on a rescue mission into the unconscious. Connect with other dreamers, or dive alone&mdash;all you need is this book and a pack of Tarot cards.</p>
