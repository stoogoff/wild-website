# The Setting

The waking world of **WILD** is similar to the world around us. The same technology, entertainment, and events. The major difference is the existence of dreamshare tech.

Pioneered by Carter Henderson, the dreamshare technology began life as an advanced BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) designed to allow users to access computers when their hands are occupied (such as pilots, divers, or astronauts) or when physically unable. It was due to revolutionise how we access computers, bringing a new level of ease to those who need to use it the most. As he was presenting this new technology at the Electronic Media Expo, he received word that his daughter, Clarity, had been involved in an accident, and she remained in a coma with above average brain activity. Carter and his team of devs spent every moment working on adapting this new BCI to allow him to communicate with Clarity within her comatose state.

And so the dreamshare device was born.

The **ALIS** device (which stands for **A**ccelerated **L**ucidity **I**nduction **S**ystem) uses a feedback loop - taking the imagery the subject is experiencing within the dream, enhancing it and sending it back into the mind of the dreamer. The result is an extremely vivid environment almost indistinguishable from the waking world. The device takes this information and can link additional users into this loop, allowing multiple dreamers to experience the same environment together, diving into the same dream, interacting with each other while simultaneously enhancing the setting.

The **ALIS** device, and its portable equivalent (**PALIS**), has gone on to be used for psychiatric research and treatment, military training, criminal investigation, as well as recreation. Delve into the subconscious mind of a patient to discover their fears and worries. Train in a hostile environment without fear of permanent injury. Uncover the evidence of a crime scene through the subconscious mind of a suspect or victim. Or simply experience the ultimate holiday of your dreams with a handful of friends, where you can live out your fantasies and be someone else entirely.

Devices have been reverse engineered on the black market for corporate espionage, information theft, idea implantation, dream ‘fight clubs’, black market trading of dream recordings, and an unsettling rise of people becoming addicted to using the device — and being unable to discern dreaming from the waking world.

Researchers at Carter’s tech company, **ClarIT** (named after his daughter) have been experimenting with multiple levels of dreamstates — dreams within dreams within dreams — and uncovering the secrets of the Collective Unconscious.

For now, you need to become acclimatised to using the ALIS device. We’ll start you off with the basics… a simple search and rescue mission. A simulation of Carter Henderson’s first dream—dive into the comatose mind of his daughter, to find her within the strange reality of her dreamscape, and help guide her to wakefulness. 

Once you’ve mastered that, you could go wherever your dreams take you.
