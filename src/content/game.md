# The Game

The **WILD: Dream Dive Training Simulation** is a tabletop roleplaying game that can be played solo, or with a group of friends with or without one player taking on the role of the DreamMaster.

You take on the role of a new recruit at ClarIT, learning the basics of the dreamshare technology by diving into a training simulation of Carter Henderson’s attempt to communicate with his comatose daughter. However, the environment is defined randomly, meaning every dive into this simulation will be different. 

Characters are defined by four Attributes, and five Abilities. Tasks, whether this is doing something dangerous, convincing someone (or something) to do something, or engaging in combat, are resolved with a simple draw of Tarot cards. Minor Arcana values under your Attribute + Ability is a Success. Matching the suit that relates to the Attribute being used is another Success, and drawing a card that matches the Ability is also a Success. The more Successes you draw, the better the result and the more likely you are to avoid any consequences. Major Arcana do weird things… 

Playtesting revealed that everything is resolved very quickly, whether this is fighting bodyguards in high-rise offices, or convincing a subconscious projection to reveal important information.

The Tarot is a very important element to WILD, and the game can be played using a standard Tarot deck like the traditional Rider-Waite-Smith deck. If you do not have access to Tarot cards, a random card draw system is provided for use with dice. However, we hope that this Kickstarter is successful enough to fund a dedicated custom Tarot deck.

The Tarot also defines the course of the dive - the locations you explore, the people you meet, and the obstacles you face. These can be defined in advance, elaborated by a DreamMaster, or drawn and interpreted on the spot. Every dive will be different and can go on for as long as you define, or until you wake from your injuries, or find Clarity within her dreamscape.
